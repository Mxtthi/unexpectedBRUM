## todo

- change the way crossings work // try to get more t-crossing
- build track so it goes back to start
- arr with roads player has driven on, has to have 90%+ or run is invalid -> prevent shortcuts
- redesign start/end
- change the way acceleration/breaking works -> percentage

somehow end-part is often missing -> error
